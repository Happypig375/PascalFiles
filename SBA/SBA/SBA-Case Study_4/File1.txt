Try to identify the program involved.  One way to do this is
to see if the error occurs when the program is not running.
If you suspect a memory resident program or device driver,
try by passing it when your computer starts.

Try changing the order in which you load device drivers and
Memory resident programs. This might help because some
errors occur only under specific memory conditions.

If you are using compressed floppy disks with automounting enabled,
you might encounter error messages or other problems while using File
Manager.
